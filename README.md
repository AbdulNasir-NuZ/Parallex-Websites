## Parallax Scrolling Website - Jungle Theme  

I've crafted an immersive **Parallax Scrolling Website**, where elements move at different speeds to create a stunning 3D effect. Using a combination of **HTML and CSS**, I’ve designed a visually engaging experience that leaves a lasting impression on users.  

This project demonstrates how simple frontend technologies can be used to create modern, dynamic, and interactive web designs without relying on heavy frameworks or libraries.
